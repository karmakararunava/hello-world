# hello-world
Hello everybody!
It's my first repository!
I like to work with Rapberry Pi and inclined towards Embedded Systems.
I have a keen interest in VLSI and have a basic knowledge of VHDL too.
I'm looking for internships so as to enhance and exhibit my skillset and contribute towards product development and growth of the organisation concerned.
