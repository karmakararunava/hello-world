# hello-world
Hello everybody!
It's my first repository!
I like to work with Rapberry Pi and inclined towards Embedded Systems.
I have a keen interest in VLSI and have a basic knowledge of VHDL too.
I'm looking forward to internships in the domain of Embedded Systems so as to enhance and exhibit my skillset and contribute towards product development and growth of the organisation concerned.
